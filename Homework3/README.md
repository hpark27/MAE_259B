# Homework 3
Python code is used for Machine learning and Google Colaboratory program is used to run the code. 
The .mat files should be saved in Google Drive, with the path 'My Drive/mae_259b_hw3_f2022'. If you want to save the files under different path, the path info should be updated in the code
The codes can be run on Google Colaboratory, and you need to upload the .ipynb files should be uploaded on Google colaboratory. 
I recommend to access to the files through Google Colaboratory instead of accesssing it through Google Drive
